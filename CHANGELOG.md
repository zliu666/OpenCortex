## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `diagnose` skill: trace agent run failures and regressions using structured evidence from run artifacts.
- OpenAI-compatible API client (`--api-format openai`) supporting any provider that implements the OpenAI `/v1/chat/completions` format, including Alibaba DashScope, DeepSeek, GitHub Models, Groq, Together AI, Ollama, and more.
- `OPENHARNESS_API_FORMAT` environment variable for selecting the API format.

- `docs/SHOWCASE.md` with concrete OpenHarness usage patterns and demo commands.
- GitHub issue templates and a pull request template.

### Fixed

- Memory scanner now parses YAML frontmatter (`name`, `description`, `type`) instead of returning raw `---` as description.

- Memory search tokenizer handles Han characters for multilingual queries.
- Fixed duplicate response in React TUI caused by double Enter key submission in the input handler.

### Changed

- README now links to contribution docs, changelog, showcase material, and provider compatibility guidance.
